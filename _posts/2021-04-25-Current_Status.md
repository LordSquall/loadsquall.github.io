As this blog has been setup after the project began, I figured the best thing to do would be give an overview of whats happening, and how far along we have gotten.

So the project started about 2 year ago as a way to playing around with a bunch of open-source libraries. The goal really was all around learning. Development was VERY slow due to only spending time on the project around work hours and family life.

Overtime the project grew into a multi-headed beast of half working source code and random (often not working) code examples. 

As most of the work being done was around rendering techniques and networking, I decided to look at combining all this into a single environment.

So this brings us to developing a Game Engine and toolchain. 

Now to be honest, this won't be my first attempt at this...
Over the years there have been a couple of none starter projects which, while greatly improving my personal knowledge, never saw the light of day.

Therefore this project is slightly different. Before working on a bunch of rendering systems, then giving up because in my own words 'creating a game with this is too hard...' I've decided to focus effort on establishing a solid platform and editor tool first. 

And this is were we currently are :)
