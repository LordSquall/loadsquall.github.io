In order to pull all the old material together into a single location, a new tab has been added to the blog called 'Gallery'.

As part of this new page, the first section added is called 'Legacy Media'. The plan is to capture all the old screenshots, gifs and videos that were taken during the initial development.

Granted there aren't a huge amount as the project wasn't planned to go much further then a personal experimental playground :) However from this point on documenting the design and development is part of the process.

The current investigation of development is around converting the current internal scene architecture from complex objects to a more ECS style approach. So watch this space :p
